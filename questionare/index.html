  <p><strong>Who is the target audience?</strong></p>
  <p>Those looking to join Greek life on campus at Ualr.</p>
  <p>Secondary audience: parents whose sons are considering rushing.</p>
  <p>Third audience: those interested in learning more about the Delta Chi fraternity.</p>

  <p><strong>How can I tailor the website to reach that audience?</strong></p>
  <p>My personal experience was that I based a lot of my decision to join Delta Chi over Kappa Sig based on the national organization's website. Delta Chi has a lot of excellent content about what they were about, what fundraising they do, and what their values are. I would like to clone their website to an extent but localize it to our chapter. Answering who we are as present Brothers, our local history, and how we are accomplishing our values. It has to be easy to find. Need to use Google SEO practices, make sure our chapter website is placed on the Greek life section of UALR. QR code on a banner for recruiting events and tabling.</p>

  <p><strong>What are the goals for the site?</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>To have an excellent web presence for our local Delta Chi chapter.</li>
    <li>Reach guys interested in joining a fraternity.</li>
    <li>Educate the public about Greek life.</li>
    <li>Offer additional information to parents regarding Delta Chi practices and combat the stigma around hazing with fraternities.</li>
    <li>Offer a place to have up-to-date happenings with the Brothers of Delta Chi.</li>
    <li>Feature active members and showcase their educational achievements and leadership abilities.</li>
    <li>Have a Delta Chi Brothers-only section (login required) for a bulletin board and local chapter documentation.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>How will I gather the information?</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Existing local chapter website: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ualrdeltachi/home" target="_blank">https://sites.google.com/view/ualrdeltachi/home</a></li>
    <li>National chapter site: <a href="https://deltachi.org" target="_blank">https://deltachi.org</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>What are my sources for multimedia content?</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Photos taken from various on-campus events.</li>
    <li>Fundraising promo video for Pie a Chi.</li>
    <li>Professional headshots taken by a student majoring in photography.</li>
    <li>Content available from the national Delta Chi site.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>What is my budget?</strong></p>
  <p>No budget assigned for this project. Would like to pull site hosting cost estimates and the price of a domain to propose to the Little Rock Delta Chi chapter executive board.</p>

  <p><strong>How long do I have to complete the project?</strong></p>
  <p>Figma prototype due April 3rd. Final website deadline Tuesday, May 13th at 10 am.</p>

  <p><strong>Who is on my project team?</strong></p>
  <p>Will be consulting with Noah Davidson, president of the Little Rock chapter of Delta Chi, and the executive board to workshop site requests and receive feedback on the website.</p>

  <p><strong>How often should the site be updated?</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Start of each semester: update dates about the next recruiting and rush.</li>
    <li>After rush: refresh current active members, including featuring a new brother or two from that semester's rush.</li>
    <li>Use of content management system for article updates. Potential RSS feed for Facebook and Instagram pages on the site.</li>
    <li>4 to 5 times a year, handled by a brother that is part of the Public Relations committee.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Who is responsible for updating the site?</strong></p>
  <p>Currently myself during my time in school, with opportunities to train other web design and development majors, computer science, or mass communications majors that we may receive later.</p>
