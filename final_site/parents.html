<H1> Letter to Parent's</H1>
        <p>Dear Parent's</p>

        <p>
<p>If you're reading this page it is most likely because your son has expressed interest in joining an IFC Fraternity. Greek life at UA Little Rock is smaller than most other universities, for our campus caters to a large number of nontraditional students. Despite this notion, our motivation to instill brotherhood, academics, and character on the lives of our members is stronger than one could ever imagine. </p>

<p>The UA Little Rock Chapter of the Delta Chi Fraternity was established in 2016, making it one of the newest greek organizations on campus. Our brotherhood dates way back to October 13, 1890 when eleven law students at Cornell University formed a Law Fraternity. In 1922, the Delta Chi officially became a social fraternity, thus allowing men in all areas of study to join the brotherhood. In 1929, Delta Chi became the first fraternity to officially abolish hazing practices associated with “hell week.” Since our founding at Cornell, Delta Chi has grown to more than 120 chapters and colonies across the United States and Canada and has initiated more than 107,000 brothers.</p> 

<p>Delta Chi has a strict no tolerance policy against any practices that are or may appear to be hazing.  Hazing in any form is a direct violation of both the Ten Basic Expectations of a Delta Chi and the oath that every member takes during his initiation. We take any actions that put any member or associate member in danger very seriously. We  encourage either you or your son to contact the fraternity if there are any concerns about our hazing policy. </p>

<p>All of our members are eligible for scholarships and academic awards. The Foundation provides grants to those attending educational leadership seminars and conferences across the United States. It also offers scholarships to incoming freshmen at many colleges and universities for non-members with no requirement for future membership.

<p>We understand the questions that parents have about joining a fraternity. People join people, and we want to help ensure that your son makes the best decision possible. If we can ever be of any assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.</p>

<b>Best Regards,</b>

<p>UA Little Rock Chapter of the Delta Chi Fraternity </p>
